If you have GitHub Codespaces access, this is for you. To run:

- Click 'Code' on GitHub, then 'Open with Codespaces' and click 'New codespace'
- Wait for the containers to build (only happens once, takes about 4 minutes to generate your app)
- Create `.env` file with your Shopify Partner API keys when the Codespace is up
- Run `rails s` and hit port 3000 on your Codespace to start
- It works!

(If you don't have Codespaces access, you can test this out locally anyway by using VS Code with the [Remote tool pack](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) and [Docker plugins](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)).
